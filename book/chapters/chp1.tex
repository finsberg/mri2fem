\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chp:chp1}

Our brain is our most precious, yet most mysterious organ. It consists
of 100 billion neurons, each neuron typically having 10,000 connections
of lengths of up to a meter. As such, it is a intricate web in which
and with which we experience the world. In addition to neurons,
the brain consists of about the same number of glial cells, around 700
kilometers of blood vessels, and the extracellular matrix, and is
surrounded by clear water-like cerebrospinal fluid, which
together all work to maintain the delicate neurons' environment in a
healthy state.  An adult human brain weighs around 3 pounds (or 
$\sim$1.3 kg); yet it contains nearly 86 billion neurons, another 85 billion 
glial cells and over 400 miles ($\sim$644 km) of capillaries.  At the 
whole-organ level, this is already an enormous amount of complexity yet we 
still have not added several factors; such as the large-scale vasculature or 
the flow of the interstitial fluid.  Due to the innate micro-scale complexity 
of the brain,  %
%
%Given the vast numbers of neurons, glial cells and
%blood vessels, 
a natural approach, attempting to understand the brain's physiology
and function, is homogenized, continuum-based modeling;  here, the 
focus is on modeling the large-scale behavior arising from the aggregate of 
small-scale contributions. 

While continuum-based brain modeling has many applications, our
motivation for writing this book and the corresponding software tools
comes from recent theories concerning the restorative mechanisms of
sleep. Recent theories consider the brain a porous and elastic
(poroelastic) medium, where the elastic medium consists of the cells
and the fluid-filled pores are the extra-cellular matrix (of course, 
hyper- and viscoelastic materials~\cite{goriely2015mechanics,
  budday2019fifty} could also be considered). In this setting, a
paradigm shift was introduced by the glymphatic theory, proposed and
developed over the last eight years by the Nedergaard
group~\cite{iliff2012paravascular}. The glymphatic theory proposes
that extra-cellular diffusion, as described in the seminal work of
Sykov{\'a} and Nicholson~\cite{sykova2008diffusion}, is not sufficient
to explain the fundamental transport processes in the brain. In
particular, pressure-driven convective flow is hypothesized to wash
away the larger molecules of the metabolic waste products produced
during the day~\cite{iliff2012paravascular, jessen2015glymphatic,
  xie2013sleep}. Such metabolic waste proteins are observed to
accumulate in patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease.

This topic has received a great deal of attention from the modeling
community concerning the mechanisms at the microscopic level,
e.g.~\cite{aldea2019cerebrovascular, daversin2020mechanisms,
  diem2017arterial, holter2017interstitial, ray2019analysis,
  sharp2019dispersion, smith2017test}, to name but a few. However,
very few works address the macroscopic level and how to employ
modeling in a patient-specific manner, see e.g.,~\cite{chou2016fully,
  lee2019mixed}. Mesh generation based on medical images and typically
integration of images of different types is crucial to achieve
patient-specific assessment. Our intention with this book is to equip
the reader with software tools to perform such types of studies.

Many other applications involve continuum-based models of
the brain's physiology.  For instance, alternative macroscopic
theories involving the prion-related development of Alzheimer's
disease have been proposed~\cite{fornari2019prion,
  kevrekidis2020anisotropic}. Another interesting observation is the
fact that astronauts often experience visual impairments and are at
risk of developing early dementia as a consequence of their periods in
low or zero gravity. The reason seems to be intracranial pressure
changes and a shift in fluid volumes in intracranial
compartments~\cite{alperin2018spaceflight}.  Another well-known
computational modeling problem is motivated by epilepsy. A hot
research topic in this area is the inverse problem of
electroencephalography (EEG) of determining the source of an epileptic
seizure via an elliptic PDE~\cite{grech2008review}.

This book focuses on creating the basic foundation, of computational resources, 
necessary to enable continuum-based modeling of the human brain.  Though we 
don't focus explicitly on the exciting multiphysics applications mentioned 
above, the approach discussed here is generalizable to multiphysics problems.  %
%
%This book will not dive deeply into any of the applications mentioned
%above, but we wish to enable personalized continuum-based modeling in
%an accessible manner.  
You, the reader of this book, will learn how to formulate, set-up and implement 
mathematical and computational models of brain biophysics in patient-specific 
geometries using finite element simulations and MR images (see Figure
\ref{fig:chp1:pipeline}). We will use the evolution and distribution
of a solute concentration due to diffusion as a model problem, and
increase the complexity of the data and techniques involved in the
course of the book. Of course, the process involves several challenges
and pitfalls which will be outlined.

\section{A model problem}

\index{diffusion equation}
Suppose that we aim to study the diffusion of a solute concentration
in a region of the brain. The region $\Omega$ could represent the left
brain hemisphere or a smaller region such as the hippocampus, while
the concentration $u$ could represent an injected tracer used in
imaging (such as gadobutrol~\cite{ringstad2018brain} or
dextran~\cite{iliff2013cerebral}) or possibly a metabolic waste
protein associated with neurodegenerative disease such as
amyloid-$\beta$ or tau. We can describe this model problem by a
time-dependent partial differential equation (PDE): find the
concentration $u = u(t, x)$ at spatial points $x \in \Omega$ and time
points $t > 0$ such that
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:diffusion}
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:diffusion:a}
    u_t - \Div D \Grad u &= f &&\text{ in } (0, T] \times \Omega, \\
    \label{eq:diffusion:b}
    u &= u_d && \text{ on } (0, T] \times \partial \Omega, \\
    \label{eq:diffusion:c}
    u(0, \cdot) &= u_0 && \text{ in } \Omega.
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
In the diffusion equation~\eqref{eq:diffusion:a}, $u$ is the unknown
field, while $D$ is the diffusion tensor coefficient and $f$
represents any source or sink for the concentration within the
domain. The subscript $t$ denotes the time derivative, $\Div$
represents the divergence and $\Grad$ the spatial gradient. The second
equation~\eqref{eq:diffusion:b} gives a boundary condition: the
function $u_d$ represents a known distribution of the concentration on
the boundary $\partial \Omega$ for all times. The third
equation~\eqref{eq:diffusion:c} gives an initial condition for the
solute concentration: the function $u_0$ represents the known initial
concentration distribution throughout $\Omega$ at $t=0$. The combined
problem \eqref{eq:diffusion} is a complete initial boundary-value
problem and will be our model problem.


%\section{A brief overview of brain physiology}
%Throughout this book we will refer to various clinical terms.  Many of these 
%are pertinent to our efforts here, such as those describing the different 
%types of medical images we will use, and will be discussed.  However, we will 
%often refer to various physiological terms that we will not discuss rigorously. 
%In this section, we briefly overview some basic physiology that may be benefit 
%readers who are largely unfamiliar with neuroscience.
%
%The brain is part of the central nervous system, which also includes the spinal 
%cord and cranial nerves.  At a high level, the brain is organized into two 
%hemispheres (left and right) which are connected by a structure called the 
%\textit{corpus callosum}. Each hemisphere can be further subdivided into four 
%\textit{lobes} called the \textit{frontal}, \textit{parietal}, 
%\textit{temporal} and \textit{occipital} lobes.  Each lobe is comprised of 
%several regions which can be further mapped to brain function; for instance, 
%areas in the temporal lobe are associated to memory and emotion while the 
%frontal lobe is associated with decision-making, attention, movement, and 
%speech, etc.
%
%The brain is composed of neurons and glial cells. 
%The neurons send and receive the electrical impulses central to our thoughts, 
%memories and basic function. The glial cells are the most numerous cells in 
%the brain; their primary function is to maintain homeostasis, support the 
%neurons and provide the insulating tissue, called myelin, that enable the 
%transmission of electrical signals between neurons.  Each neuron is comprised 
%of a soma (cell body) and two types of projected structures: the dendritic 
%projections (or dendrites) receive signals from other neurons while the 
%axonal projections (or axons) send signals to other neurons.  
%
%The brain can largely be viewed in terms of \textit{gray matter} and 
%\textit{white matter}.  The gray matter, also called the cortex, is made up of 
%the cell bodies of the neurons, the dendrites, the axons that are not coated 
%in myelin along with the synapses and glial cells.  The white matter, which 
%is `below' the gray matter or `subcortical', is made up mostly of those axons 
%that are covered in myelin; the white matter, which appears white due to 
%the myelin, provides the connectivity between neurons across larger distances 
%within the brain. 
%
%The brain sits within the skull but three primary layers of tissue, called 
%the \textit{meninges}, which sit between the cortical surface and the skull 
%cranium \cite{rua2018}.  Nearest to the cortex is the \textit{pia mater}, 
%referred to within this text as the pial surface.  The pial surface hugs the 
%cortex and is blanketed with blood vessels.  Many of these vessels descend 
%into the brain via pial invaginations and the pia plays a role in forming the 
%perivascular (or Virchow-Robin) spaces, surrounding the vessel, as it descends 
%from the pial surface.  Above the pial layer is the \textit{arachnoid mater} 
%which is comprised of layers of connective tissue but does not contain blood 
%vessels.  
%
%The area between the pial mater and the arachnoid mater is called the 
%\textit{subarachnoid space} (SAS).  The SAS is made up of delicate connective 
%tissue trabeculae through which the blood vessels, on the surface of the 
%pia, wind their way through; the SAS is also filled with \textit{cerebrospinal 
%fluid} (CSF).  CSF is produced by a structure in the brain called the 
%\textit{ventricles} and circulates from the ventricles, around the brain and 
%down into the spinal column.  CSF provides a protective barrier to the brain 
%and aids in homeostasis; see e.g.~\cite{khasawneh2018}, and the sources therein, 
%for an introduction.  The last meningeal layer is the \textit{dura mater} which 
%further protects the brain and also contains special vessels, called lymphatic 
%vessels, which provide essential immune system function throughout the body.


\section{On reading this book}
This text does not assume that the reader is well versed in anatomy or in 
neuroscience.  In fact, the bulk of the anatomical familiarity needed to 
successfully follow along with this text is covered in 
Chapter~\ref{sec:chp2:anatomy}.  We have also made liberal use of footnotes and 
citations to inform the reader of additionally interesting, or contextually 
useful, anatomical or physiological details. This text does, however, assume a 
basic knowledge of PDEs. For instance, the diffusion equation 
\eqref{eq:diffusion} is a classical continuum-based PDE with well-known 
behavior in both the mathematical and numerical sense. The reader unfamiliar 
with this equation is advised to first consult an introductory text on solving 
PDEs using the finite element
method~\cite{gockenbach2006understanding,
  langtangen2016solving, langtangen2019introduction,tveito2004introduction}.

The reader is assumed to be comfortable executing commands from a
command line in a terminal window (also canonically referred
to as a command window or command prompt). Terminal commands
will throughout be formatted as:
\terminal{\$ cd ..}
\noindent Commands at the operating-system (OS) level, such as that above,
can differ from OS to OS, and we mainly demonstrate Linux commands
here.

We also assume the reader is familiar with the fundamentals of the
Python programming language or, alternatively, can understand the
syntax well enough to follow the source code that appears throughout;
we will not use any advanced Python programming techniques. We use
Python 3 throughout, and we must therefore make sure that we have Python
version 3.0 or any later version installed. You can check
your Python version by either of the following terminal commands:
\terminal{\$ python {\ddash}version \\
\$ python3 {\ddash}version
}

We will use the Python interface to the FEniCS Project finite
element software~\cite{alnaes2015fenics}, and we assume that the
reader is familiar with the material covered by the FEniCS
tutorial~\cite{langtangen2016solving}.

tools are available for a number of operating systems, with separate
installation instructions and dependencies for each system. For the
key external tools, in this book, we provide installation instructions for Linux
Ubuntu (version 20.04, but earlier or later versions might also work
fine). Whenever we refer to an Ubuntu specific terminal command, we
format it as follows:
\ubuntu{\$ sudo apt-get install ... }
\noindent We note that, before installing packages, it can be important to update
the Ubuntu package list. This can be done by the following command:
\ubuntu{\$ sudo apt-get update}
\noindent For other operating systems, we refer to the specific
software documentation for installation instructions.

\section{Book outline}

This book covers the following material. We give an
introduction to brain physiology and brain imaging in
Chapter~\ref{chp:chp2}, as well as survey the software ecosystem
that will take us from MR images to numerical
simulation. In Chapter~\ref{chp:chp3}, our aim is to get up and
running quickly: we step through the entire pipeline from generating a
volume mesh from MR image data to solving our model
problem~\eqref{eq:diffusion} on this mesh. In Chapter~\ref{chp:chp4},
we cover more aspects of meshing including distinguishing between gray and
white matter, merging left and right hemispheres, and adding
parcellation labels. In Chapter~\ref{chap:dti}, we focus on diffusion
tensor imaging (DTI) and demonstrate how we can convert DTI data
to a numerical tensor field. Finally, in Chapter~\ref{chp:chp6}, we
bring everything from Chapters~\ref{chp:chp3} to \ref{chap:dti} together
to present a realistic simulation of anisotropic diffusion in
heterogeneous brain regions.
