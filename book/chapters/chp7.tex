\chapter{Concluding remarks and outlook}

Physics-based modeling of brain mechanics, informed by multi-modal
imaging data, is an exciting research area at the frontier of
science. Through this introductory and hands-on text, we have aimed to
present a sufficient yet accessible amount of material to place the
reader near the research front and to establish a solid foundation for
further scientific investigations.

The MRI data to finite element pipeline presented here can be used for
further simulations of solute transport within the brain, and
importantly, provides a basis for more complex simulation
scenarios. Our techniques for creating finite element meshes from T1
MR images can be equally applicable for numerical simulation of the
brain as an elastic medium in the context of traumatic brain injuries,
as a poroelastic medium for studying neurological disorders or stroke,
or as an electrical medium for studying the propagation of epileptic
seizures. Similarly, anisotropy data extracted from DTI can inform
diffusion tensors (as here), or the permeability tensor in the context
of brain fluid movement, the conductivity tensor in the context of
brain electrophysiology, or possibly the compliance tensor(s) in the
context of brain elasticity. While such physical models have not been
considered here, the meshes and finite element simulation platform
FEniCS extend readily to these contexts.

The brain does not exist in isolation, but is tightly coupled to its
local environment, including the surrounding CSF, vasculature,
membranes and spinal cord. The components presented here can be used
as building blocks for computational modeling of the brain and its
local environment, but geometrical, numerical, and computational
challenges remain for this non-trivial multi-physics setting.

In coming decades, we envisage that mathematics and numerical
computations could play a crucial role in gaining new insights into
the mechanisms and physiological processes of the human brain. Indeed,
clinicians and experimentalists express a need for modeling and
simulation as an alternative avenue of investigation to alleviate
fundamental limitations in traditional techniques. A greater
understanding of physiology and pathology could then ultimately pave
the way for new diagnostics and treatments for a range of brain
disorders and diseases --- with immense scientific and societal
impact.
