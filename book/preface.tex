Observations surrounding the nature and fundamental biology of
humankind date back to some of our earliest written historical
accounts.  Brain pulsatile behaviour and the structure of brain
folding were described in the ancient Egyptian \textit{Edwin Smith
Surgical Papyrus}\footnote{The text is named after the dealer who
bought it} dating back to 1700 BC.  Hippocrates, the father of
medicine, hypothesized that the brain was the \textit{seat of
intelligence}, while Aristotle was fascinated by and wrote about
both \textit{sleep} and \textit{dreams}. However, early methods of
investigating human anatomy directly were crude and invasive.
Arguably, one of the profound medical achievements of our modern age
is the advent of non-invasive imaging technologies.

The imaging revolution was born with Wilhelm R{\"o}ntgen's discovery of
x-rays already in 1895. A few years later, Marie Curie successfully
isolated radium, and x-rays then began to be used medically. Still,
even with these early breakthroughs, positron emission tomography
(PET) would not arrive until 1950, and it would be 1967 before the
first clinical x-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner was put to use.
An explosive development of different techniques followed these
successes.  We now have many new imaging methods at our disposal; in
addition to PET and CT, the various magnetic resonance (MR) imaging
techniques have proven to be indispensable for understanding the brain
of living patients. The medical imaging field is now vast. For
instance, the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North
America hosts around 25,000 attendees, while the corresponding number
for the meeting of the Society for Neuroscience is 44,000.

Meanwhile, engineering and industrial applications have led to the
rapid development of both numerical methods, and applications using
partial differential equations (PDEs) to model and understand physical
phenomena. The finite element method (FEM), in particular, was
introduced in the 1960s for solving PDEs on domains with complex
geometries. Significant work has been invested in the construction of
scalable, performant, and approachable software libraries for solving
PDEs via the FEM. Today, we have many such libraries at our disposal;
including Abaqus, COMSOL, deal.II, DUNE, and {\fenics}. However, the
generation of suitable, physiological finite element geometries for
solving PDEs over brain domains remains a practical
barrier. Therefore, the impact of computational modeling on medical
imaging and neuroscience has not yet reached its full potential. Our
aim with this book is to provide a bridge between common tools in
medical imaging and neuroscience, and the numerical solution of PDEs
that can arise in brain modelling.

The generation of physiological finite element meshes of the brain is
not generally an easy task. The sulcal and gyral folds of the cortex
are intricate, and the extracellular diffusion tensor, dictated
largely by axonal white-matter bundles, is anisotropic and
tortuous. Nevertheless, such features are essential for even the
simplest, patient-specific PDE models of brain structural deformation
and fluid dynamics. Accurately capturing anatomical features is
important for a wide variety of problems of practical interest,
particularly for understanding the mechanisms underlying
neurodegenerative pathology evolution. This book stands at the gateway
of these pressing problems.

Herein, we guide the reader through a straightforward methodology for
ascertaining the basic assets, that is, a finite element mesh and the
extracellular diffusion tensor, from a set of patient MR images. To do
so, we introduce a novel software library, the Surface Volume Meshing
Toolkit (SVM-Tk), wrapping functionality from the broad array of
capabilities provided by the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library
(CGAL), thus offering an approachable set of features specifically for
the brain modeling community. Along the way, we will also employ the
automatic segmentation capacity of the FreeSurfer tool set, a
gold-standard for MR image processing. The marriage of mathematical
modeling, clinical imaging, and numerical analysis is demonstrated by
solving a simplified PDE model of anisotropic gadobutrol diffusion in
the brain.

We are deeply grateful to the numerous colleagues who have provided
advice, and guidance, along the way as we commence our journey with
you, the reader, into the exciting world of mathematical brain
modeling. In particular, we thank Siri Fl\o gstad Svensson and Kyrre
Eeg Emblem for the imaging data, Johannes Ring for creating Docker
images, and Ana Budisa, J\o rgen Dokken, Kyrre Eeg Emblem, Ingeborg
Gjerde, Martin Hornkj\o l, Miroslav Kuchta, Yngve Mardal Moe, Geir
Ringstad, Vegard Vinje, and Bastian Zapf for their extremely
constructive feedback on the book and the associated software. 
Jacob Schreiner has made significant contributions to SVM-Tk and
finally, the first and last author wish to thank 
Anders M. Dale for hosting several research visits to La Jolla, 
which were instrumental for starting this project.
