## Downloading data
# A sample dataset is available at Zenodo (search for mri2fem
# dataset). The script download_data will download the current
# version of this dataset for you:

./download_data.sh

## Setting the data path
# These scripts rely on knowing the location of the data set, and in
# particular the environment variable MRI2FEMDATA. Source the script
# setup_mri2fem_dataset.sh to set this path

source setup_mri2fem_dataset.sh

## Running all scripts
# Each chapter directory has an all.sh script for running all scripts
# in that directory. All directories can be run via the top-level
# script:

./all.sh

## Converting an tetrahedral SVMTk .mesh file to a FEniCS 
# compatible XDMF.  The SVMTk uses CGAL to write .mesh files 
# which are output in MEDIT format.  At the time of writing, 
# meshio would convert MEDIT formatted files to a FEniCS 
# compatible XDMF format.  However, recent updates to meshio 
# now convert MEDIT formats to an XDMF format that is not 
# compatible with FEniCS.  We have included a script that 
# works around this issue.
#
# Assuming you have a (tetrahedral) brain mesh called 
$ myBrainMesh.mesh, the conversion script can be run with

python3 SVMTk-tet-mesh-to-FEniCS-XDMF.py myBrainMesh.mesh

# Two files will be produced for use, together, with the 
# FEniCS function XDMFFile(...):
# myBrainMesh.xdmf and myBrainMesh.h5

## Analogous to the above, converting a triangular SVMTk 
# .mesh file to a FEniCS compatible XDMF format can be 
# done using 

python3 SVMTk-tri-mesh-to-FEniCS-XDMF.py myBrainMesh.mesh

# where myBrainSliceMesh.mesh is a 2D triangular mesh generated
# using the volume slicing functionality of the SVMTk
