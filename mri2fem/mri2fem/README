## Downloading data
# A sample dataset is available at Zenodo (search for mri2fem
# dataset). The script download_data will download the current
# version of this dataset for you:

./download_data.sh

## Setting the data path
# These scripts rely on knowing the location of the data set, and in
# particular the environment variable MRI2FEMDATA. Source the script
# setup_mri2fem_dataset.sh to set this path

source setup_mri2fem_dataset.sh

## Running all scripts
# Each chapter directory has an all.sh script for running all scripts
# in that directory. All directories can be run via the top-level
# script:

./all.sh
